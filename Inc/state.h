/*
*the whole program is based on the state machine
*there is 7 state in this game:

	GAME_WAITTING
ï¼šnot start, waiting :
//call an funciton : into endless loop to check if the state has changed
//if the state has been changed , out of loop :let the nvic function to change state 

	GAME_START:
//out of garage, based on where the cus cal and which road to take,
//to decide whether turn left or turn right

	NO_CUS:
still has no cus and no target
//first check which cus to go 
//then design the route
//change state 

	TO_CUS:
has not cus, but has target
//first by designed route, go to target
//if near the target, close the motor to wait for the judge
//at the meantime , change state 

	WAIT_CUS:
//waiting for judge 
//if in 3s the judge is not okay, change pos a little 
//if judge is ok, change state to TO_END

	TO_DES:
//to the destination
//first cal the route
//then use the route to go
//if near the target, close motor to wait for judge 
//at the meantime , change the state

	WAIT_GET_OFF:
waiting at the end point
//waiting for the judge 
//if in 3s the judge is not okay, change pos a little 
//if judge is okay, change state 

	GAME_PAUSE
imediately stop and wait for game restart 
//if is this state : call an end_function
//[stop the target and into the endless loop, until if the state is changed]
//if the state has been changed , out of loop :let the nvic function to change state
